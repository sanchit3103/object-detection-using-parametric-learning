# Color Classification and Bin Detection using the techniques of Parametric Learning and Gaussian Naïve Bayes Model

<p align="justify">
The project aims to train a probabilistic color model to distinguish between red, green and blue pixels using the techniques of parametric learning through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and generative classification via Gaussian Naïve Bayes model. The approach is further extended to detect objects like recycling bins in images with different backgrounds. The parameters have been calculated from a large training set consisting of more than 1000-pixel samples each for red, green and blue colours using the estimation strategy of MLE. The overall model was tested on a set of validation images and completely unknown images. The results for the same are presented in the report.
